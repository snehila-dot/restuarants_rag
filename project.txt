Graz Restaurant Chatbot 🍽️🇦🇹

A chatbot that answers questions about restaurants in Graz, Austria, using a curated local dataset as its only source of truth.

This project is designed to be deterministic, hallucination-safe, and easy to extend, following pragmatic engineering principles.

🎯 Project Goal

Build a chatbot that can answer questions like:

“Best Italian restaurant in Graz”

“Vegan food near Jakominiplatz”

“Romantic dinner place”

“Restaurants open after 10 pm”

“Cheap student-friendly places”

All answers must be based only on known restaurants stored in the database.

📍 Scope

City: Graz, Austria (strict)

Domain: Restaurants only

Languages: German & English

Target: MVP first, production-ready structure

If a user asks outside Graz or outside restaurants, the system must politely decline.

🧠 Core Principle (Very Important)

The database is the knowledge base.

This project does not rely on live APIs, scraping, or external knowledge at runtime.

No Google Maps calls during chat

No Tripadvisor calls during chat

No hallucinated restaurants

If data is missing → say so

All restaurant data is collected ahead of time and stored locally.

📊 Data Strategy (Curated Local Dataset)

Restaurant data is manually curated and summarized from public sources.

Allowed sources (during dataset creation only):

Google Maps (factual info only)

Tripadvisor (tags & trends only, no reviews)

Official restaurant websites

Local Graz food blogs

Rules:

❌ No reviews stored

❌ No copyrighted text copied

✅ All descriptions are original summaries

✅ Track last verification date

🗄️ Data Model

The core entity is Restaurant.

Minimum required fields:

{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "district": "string",
  "address": "string",
  "latitude": "float",
  "longitude": "float",
  "cuisine": ["string"],
  "price_range": "€ | €€ | €€€ | €€€€",
  "opening_hours": "string or structured JSON",
  "vegan_options": "boolean",
  "vegetarian_options": "boolean",
  "gluten_free_options": "boolean",
  "outdoor_seating": "boolean",
  "takeaway": "boolean",
  "delivery": "boolean",
  "good_for": ["romantic", "groups", "students", "family", "business"],
  "ambience": ["casual", "traditional", "modern", "fine dining"],
  "rating": "float (0–5)",
  "rating_count": "integer",
  "summary": "short original description",
  "data_sources": ["google_maps", "restaurant_website", "local_blog"],
  "last_verified": "date"
}


The database must be seeded with sample data so the system runs out of the box.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
Backend

Python

FastAPI

Pydantic

SQLAlchemy

PostgreSQL (SQLite acceptable for MVP)

AI Layer

Large Language Model (LLM)

Used only for natural language generation

Temperature ≤ 0.4

Receives only filtered restaurant data

Knowledge Handling

No vector database in v1

No LangChain

No embeddings

SQL filtering + ranking only

🔄 Query Flow

User sends a message

Detect language (DE / EN)

Extract intent & constraints:

cuisine

district / location

price range

dietary needs

time constraints (“open now”, “late night”)

occasion (“romantic”, “group”)

Query database using SQL filters

Rank results

Pass results to LLM

Generate user-friendly response

📈 Ranking Logic

Ranking must happen before the LLM is called.

Weighted scoring example:

Rating

Rating count

Constraint match quality

Optional popularity bias

Ranking logic must be deterministic and explainable.

🗣️ Response Rules

Responses must:

Recommend 3–5 restaurants max

Never invent restaurants

Match user language

Be friendly and local

Ask a follow-up question only when helpful

Example response structure:

One short intro sentence

Bullet list of restaurants

One-line reason per restaurant

Optional clarification question

⚠️ Edge Cases

No results → explain why + suggest alternatives

Vague query → ask one clarifying question

Outside Graz → politely decline

Missing data → explicitly say it’s unknown

🚫 What This Project Explicitly Avoids

❌ Vector databases (for MVP)

❌ Live API calls at runtime

❌ Web scraping during chat

❌ Hallucinated knowledge

❌ Overengineering

📦 MVP Deliverables

Database schema + seed data

/chat API endpoint

Query parsing logic

Retrieval & ranking module

LLM prompt logic

Minimal UI or API-only setup

🧪 Quality Bar

Deterministic behavior

Clear separation of concerns

Clean, readable code

Easy to extend to other cities later

🔮 Future Extensions (Out of Scope for MVP)

Vector search for vague queries

Multiple cities

“Restaurants similar to X”

Owner submissions
